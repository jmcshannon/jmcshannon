# Jmcshannon User Guide

### Whoami

I'm jmcshannon, I'm passionate about 💻cybersecurity, 🐧Linux, and 🔨building my own tools.
I grew up moving between a lot of different places which is probably what started my
love for ✈️traveling and having various experiences. If I had 🕙free time I would probably spend it
hiking and traveling, but as a grad student/teacher engineer/project manager I'm currently at capacity.
I really like 😱October/Halloween and I am a horror movie afficionado, former skater 🛹 and 🎸musician.

Fun Fact: I am a job corps graduate and part of my "internship" was remediating a malware outbreak. 
It was at this point the OpsAdmin discovered this was not my first rodeo.

### Workstyle

I approach tasks through an iterative design process, I prefer solid blocks of time either early in the morning
or late at night where I can focus on complex issues and move them forward. During the non-focus hours I will usually
work on small features/support requests/and collaboration/project management items. I really like lists and tickets
and I tend to prioritize my workload based on due date and impact if not completed (is this a blocker or a nice to have?)

I also really like to come up with the solutions myself. That's like 90% of the joy for me. Let me noodle!

### COMMS
I prefer time that is set-aside for specific functions, so while I may be able to answer a quick question over chat
anything in depth would likely need to be an email and possibly a meeting where I can give you my undivided attention.

I'm a big fan of remote work/remote meetings, but you will also find me in the office most days.

As for collaboration, I like to start with defining the scope and the exact problem we are trying to solve and then just
iterating until we have developed a feature set. I think big and focus on the how from an infrastructure/network/code perspective.
**I believe we can do almost anything if we want to**.

### Jmcshannon Value Function

I'm selfishly motivated by my desire to touch all the things and learn as much as I can AND have time to go deep on the details 
that interest me. 

## **I want my work to add value to other peoples lives and to make their use case as frictionless and secure as is possible.**

### Feedback

There is a saying **"Success has many fathers, failure is an orphan"**. I own my failures, I even own failures for anything I touch if there
was something that I could have done differently that would have avoided it. 

ex.) I rerouted a significant amount of network traffic through links that were scheduled to be decommissioned. I worked with the 
decom lead to ensure that they were aware and this was all approved. A few months went by and these links were decommissioned causing a 
significant outage. I took responsibility for this because although I wasn't the one who cut the lines or pulled the links, I should have
confirmed that the decom lead removed the links from their decom schedule before I pushed prod traffic to those links. 

With that said, it is nice to hear a good job or even a thanks every now and again.

As for criticism, tread carefully, I take things pretty personally and too much criticism will significantly impact my motivation 
and drive if not sprinkled with positive feedback from time to time. If you must criticize me give me concrete examples and the desired solution.
"I think >thing you worked really hard on< is trash" is not helpful and will make me defensive and less inclined to listen to you.
Try instead, "I think >thing you worked on< is missing <desired thing<", much more likely to get added to the roadmap, especially if you can tie
it back to being frictionless and secure. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths - I'm fairly technical across a large number of domains and can own a very large and complex project from E2E.

Weaknesses - I want to do everything because it is fun for me. So delegation is something I can struggle with as well as saying no.

### Additional Info

My professional career has spanned the following domains:

* Networking
* Systems Administration
* Software Security
* Cloud Security
* Development
* Project Management

My professional development usually consists of certifications/courses and a TON of homelabbing. 

bonus fun fact: I was once referred to as "crazy" in an interview because of how extensive my homelab at the time was. I ran the following services

* SIEM (OSSec/Security Onion)
* IPS/IDS (pfSense + Suricata)
* Private GIT for scripts
* Private TFTP for provisioning (hardware based rpi lab)
* Private VPN server (for connecting to my lab remotely)
* Private Ticketing system (for filing tickets to myself so I would remember)
* Personally developed tool suite for password cracking, reverse engineering, infra management

### What do people perceive incorrectly about me

That I am standoffish, I just don't really talk unless spoken to and then I will talk too much.

### What do I not have patience for

I don't like to repeat myself over and over again. Maybe this is why I like automation? I'll tell you twice and then I'll put it in an email. 
After that you're on your own.
